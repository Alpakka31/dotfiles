# dotfiles
This repository includes my dotfiles that I use on Linux  
The 'wallpapers' directory contains wallpapers that I have found on the internet.  

The following dependencies are required to some of my config files  

- [Hack Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack)  
- [OpenBox Nord Theme](https://www.box-look.org/p/1416095/)
